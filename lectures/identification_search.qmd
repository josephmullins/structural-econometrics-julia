# The Search Model

## Identification of the Model without Heterogeneity

The @Mccall Search Model that we introduced as a [prototype model](../models/search.qmd) is an excellent introduction to the identification of structural models. A classic treatment of identification of this model is provided by @flinn1982. 


### Data

Identification arguments *always* begin with an assumption on available data. Even though the model is dynamic, we will show that all we really need is a single cross-section of data:

$$ (E_{n},t_{U,n},W_{n})_{n=0}^{N} $$

where :

- $E_{n}\in\{0,1\}$ indicates the employment status of individual $n$
- If the individual is employed ($E_{n}=1$) we see the wage, $W_{n}$, which is otherwise assumed to be missing.
- If the individual is unemployed ($E_{n}=0$), then we see the duration of unemployment $t_{U,n}$, which is otherwise assumed to be missing.

### Steady State

A key assumption for identification in this case is that the economy is in **steady state**. Let $U_{t}$ be fraction of individuals that are unemployed at time $t$. Let $p_{\tau,t}$ be the fraction of individuals at time $t$ with unemployment duration $\tau$. In general, these objects evolve according to the rules:

\begin{eqnarray}
U_{t+1} = (1-h)U_{t} + \delta (1-U_{t+1}) \\
p_{\tau+1,t+1} = (1-h)p_{\tau,t} \\
p_{0,t+1} = \delta (1-U_{t})
\end{eqnarray}
where $h$ is the "hazard rate" of exiting unemployment, $\lambda(1-F_{W}(w^*))$. Enforcing that these objects are constant between $t$ and $t+1$ (the steady state assumption) gives:

\begin{eqnarray}
U_{t} = \frac{\delta}{\delta+h} \\
p_\tau = \frac{\delta h}{\delta+h}(1-h)^{\tau}
\end{eqnarray}

### Writing Joint Probabilities

With these probabilities in hand, we can write the sampling distribution $\mathbb{P}$ in terms of equilibrium objects:

$$ \mathbb{P}(E,t_U,W) = \left(\frac{h}{h+\delta}f_{W}(W|W>w^*)\right)^{E}\left(\frac{\delta h}{\delta+h}(1-h)^{t_{U}}\right)^{1-E} $$

### Thinking Through Identification

Often it is helpful to break down the joint distribution of observables into unconditional and conditional distributions. Notice here that:

$$ \mathbb{P}(t_{U}|E=0) = h\times(1-h)^{t_{U}} $$

and so the hazard rate $h$ can be inferred from the distribution of unemployment durations.

Next, notice that the probability of being unemployed is 

$$ \mathbb{P}(E=0) = \frac{\delta}{\delta+h} $$

and so $\delta$ is given by $h$ (which we now know) and the fraction of unemployed.

Finally, we see that

$$ \mathbb{P}(W|E=1) = f_{W}(W|W>w^*) $$

Observed wages are equal to the offer distribution *conditional on the wage offer being acceptable*. This tells us that, although the conditional distribution can be identifiable, we do not know the distribution of wage offers that are never accepted (those below $w^*$). This is still sufficient to identify $w^*$ however, since it is the lower bound on the support of this conditional distribution. 

Can we identify the deeper structural parameters, $b$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$? Not quite. Let's rewrite the reservation wage equation as:

$$ w^* = b + h\int_{w^*}\frac{1-F(W|W>w^*)}{1-\beta(1-\delta)}dw $$

and we can see that infinitely many combinations of $b$ and $\beta$ can rationalize the same reservation wage. Assuming a plausible value for $\beta$ (you will learn that this is common across many structural estimation exercises), $b$ is identified by this equation.
