# Identification of the Model without Heterogeneity

- The McCall Search Model is an excellent introduction to identification of structural models
- Classic treatment: Flinn and Heckman (1982)

---

## Data

- Identification arguments *always* begin with an assumption on available data
- Even though the model is dynamic, we only need a single cross-section:
$$(E_n, t_{U,n}, W_n)_{n=0}^{N}$$

### Variables

- $E_n \in \{0,1\}$: employment status of individual $n$
- If employed ($E_n = 1$): observe wage $W_n$ (otherwise missing)
- If unemployed ($E_n = 0$): observe unemployment duration $t_{U,n}$ (otherwise missing)

### CPS Data Example (Key Results)

- Panel dimension: more than half of individuals appear in multiple months
- Transition rates can be measured from panel:
  - Low separation rate (EU)
  - Relatively high hazard rate out of unemployment (UE)
- Observable heterogeneity matters: transition rates differ by education, race, sex

---

## Steady State Assumption

- Key assumption for identification: economy is in **steady state**
- Let $U_t$ = fraction unemployed at time $t$
- Let $p_{\tau,t}$ = fraction with unemployment duration $\tau$ at time $t$

### Laws of Motion

\begin{eqnarray}
U_{t+1} &=& (1-h)U_t + \delta(1-U_{t+1}) \\
p_{\tau+1,t+1} &=& (1-h)p_{\tau,t} \\
p_{0,t+1} &=& \delta(1-U_t)
\end{eqnarray}

- $h$ = hazard rate of exiting unemployment $= \lambda(1-F_W(w^*))$
- $\delta$ = separation rate

### Steady State Distribution

- Enforcing constant values between $t$ and $t+1$:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_t &=& \frac{\delta}{\delta + h} \\
p_\tau &=& \frac{\delta h}{\delta + h}(1-h)^\tau
\end{eqnarray}

---

## Writing Joint Probabilities

- Sampling distribution in terms of equilibrium objects:
$$\mathbb{P}(E, t_U, W) = \left(\frac{h}{h+\delta}F_W(W|W>w^*)\right)^E \left(\frac{\delta h}{\delta+h}(1-h)^{t_U}\right)^{1-E}$$

---

## Thinking Through Identification

### Step 1: Identify $h$ from duration distribution

- Conditional distribution of unemployment durations:
$$\mathbb{P}(t_U | E=0) = h \times (1-h)^{t_U}$$
- The hazard rate $h$ is directly identified from the distribution of durations

### Step 2: Identify $\delta$ from unemployment rate

- Probability of being unemployed:
$$\mathbb{P}(E=0) = \frac{\delta}{\delta + h}$$
- Since $h$ is now known, $\delta$ is identified from the unemployment rate

### Step 3: Wage distribution and reservation wage

- Observed wages equal the offer distribution *conditional on acceptance*:
$$\mathbb{P}(W|E=1) = F_W(W|W>w^*)$$
- The conditional distribution is identified, but not offers below $w^*$
- Let $\underline{w}$ = lower bound on observed wage distribution
- The reservation wage is identified: $w^* = \underline{w}$

### Step 4: Deeper structural parameters

- Rewrite the reservation wage equation:
$$w^* = b + \beta h \int_{w^*} \frac{1-F(W|W>w^*)}{1-\beta(1-\delta)} dw$$
- Infinitely many combinations of $b$ and $\beta$ rationalize the same $w^*$
- Common approach: **assume a plausible value for $\beta$**, then $b$ is identified

---

# Credibility and a Policy Counterfactual

## The Policy

- Consider a tax credit $\tau$ proportional to earnings
- Under the counterfactual, value function becomes:
$$V(w) = (1+\tau)w + \delta U + (1-\delta)V(w)$$

## New Reservation Wage Equation

$$w^* = \frac{b}{1+\tau} + \frac{\beta\lambda}{1-\beta(1-\delta)} \int_{w^*}[1-F_W(w)]dw$$

- Effect of subsidy: equivalent to reducing flow utility of unemployment

## Credibility Concerns

- Forecasting the counterfactual: re-calculate reservation wage with estimates
- **Problem:** Forecast depends on arbitrary parametric assumptions about wage distribution below $w^*$
- For a tax ($\tau < 0$): slightly better since it uses observable wage distribution
- But underlying assumption is stark: policy effect inferred from cross-sectional wage distribution without any policy variation

### Key Observation

- Initial identification seems reasonable
- But credibility must be viewed through the lens of the **specific research question**
- Evaluate identification strengths/weaknesses relative to desired counterfactuals

# Identification with an Exclusion Restriction

## Setup

- Variable $Z$ enters model only through flow utility of unemployment
- Reservation wage equation becomes:
$$w^*(z) = b(z) + \frac{\beta\lambda}{1-\beta(1-\delta)} \int_{w^*(z)}[1-F_W(w)]dw$$
- $Z$ is an **excluded variable**: affects selection into/out of jobs without moving wage offer distribution

## Key Definitions

- $\underline{w}(z)$ = lower bound on conditional sampling distribution $\mathbb{P}(W|E=1,Z)$
- $\underline{w}_F$ = lower bound on support of offer distribution $F_W$
- As before: $w^*(z) = \underline{w}(z)$

## Identification Strategy

- Suppose $Z$ has sufficient variation such that:
$$\underline{\mathcal{Z}} = \{z: w^*(z) \leq \underline{w}_F\}$$
has positive measure

- Then:
  - $\underline{w}_F = \inf_z \underline{w}(z) = \underline{w}$
  - The set is identified: $\underline{\mathcal{Z}} = \{z: \underline{w}(z) = \underline{w}\}$
  - $F_W$ is nonparametrically identified:
  $$F_W(w) = \mathbb{P}(w|E=1,z), \quad z \in \underline{\mathcal{Z}}$$

### Key Insight

- Policy forecast now uses **articulated variation**
- Model treats wage scaling as equivalent to variation in $b$
- Can recreate experiment by interpolating existing variation in $b$

---

## Further Identification by Functional Form

- Suppose $b(z)$ is linear: $b(z) = b_0 + b_1 z$
- For three values $(z, z', z'')$:
$$w^*(z') - w^*(z) = b_1(z'-z) + \frac{\beta\lambda}{1-\beta(1-\delta)} \int_{w^*(z)}^{w^*(z')}[1-F_W(w)]dw$$
$$w^*(z'') - w^*(z) = b_1(z''-z) + \frac{\beta\lambda}{1-\beta(1-\delta)} \int_{w^*(z)}^{w^*(z'')}[1-F_W(w)]dw$$

- Two equations, two unknowns ($\beta$ and $b_1$)
- Thus $\beta$ is identified by functional form restrictions

---

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{
\textbf{STOP FOR DISCUSSION}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notice that now the policy counterfactual is given by additional parameters that attempt to match how wages and hazard rates respond to existing policy variation.
\item How do you feel about this approach relative to the case without variation?
\item How do you feel about the model's key implication that variation in $b$ is equivalent to variation in $\tau$?
\item What would be an alternative and potentially preferable source of variation?
\end{itemize}
}}
\end{center}

---

## Identification with Known Scale Restrictions

- If $Z$ is a policy variable (e.g., welfare payment generosity):
$$b(z) = b_0 + Z$$
- Here $\beta$ is identified directly

### Importance of $\beta$

- Key parameter for matching effect of $Z$
- Determines response of reservation wages and hazard rates to policy

---

# The Whether vs How of Identification

## Setup with Two Instruments

- $(Z_1, Z_2)$: $Z_1$ shifts $b$, $Z_2$ shifts wages
- $Z_2$: labor demand shifter or marginal tax rate policy
- Assume:
$$\log(W) = \log(\omega) + \log(\mu(Z_2)), \quad Z_2 \perp \omega$$

- Reservation wage in terms of $\omega^*$:
$$\omega^*(z_1,z_2) = \frac{b(z_1)}{\mu(z_2)} + \frac{\beta\lambda}{1-\beta(1-\delta)} \int_{\omega^*(z_1,z_2)}(1-F_\omega(\omega))d\omega$$

## Over-Identification

- Model is **over-identified**: only need subset of data
- Hazard rates:
$$h(z_1,z_2) = \lambda(1-F_\omega(\omega^*(z_1,z_2)))$$
- Hazard rate identified from duration distribution, conditional on $(z_1, z_2)$
- But ratio $h(z'_1,z'_2)/h(z_1,z_2)$ also determined by wage data alone

## Two Approaches to Over-Identification

1. **Enrich the model** using "spare" features of data
2. **Choose estimation approach** to make answer most credible (Marschak's maxim)
   - Model is misspecified
   - Cannot match every feature simultaneously
   - **The "how" of identification:** which features will you use?

---

## Key Tensions

1. **Shape of hazard function** identified from wage data
   - Hazard rates determine unemployment rates
   - Responsiveness to $Z_1, Z_2$ determines how unemployment shifts

2. **Model restriction:** $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ work through same mechanism
   - Identical effect on reservation wages
   - Strong restriction unlikely to hold in extended models
   - Do we want identification to rely on this if we don't have to?

---

## Returning to the Question of Interest

- Want to evaluate policy varying marginal tax rates
- Most convincing: show parameters replicate effects of pre-existing, functionally identical variation

### Options

1. **Minimum Distance:** Match moments from joint distribution of durations and $z_2$
2. **Indirect Inference:** Match quasi-experimental estimates of $Z_2$ effects on wages/hazard rates
3. **Maximum Likelihood:** Maximize likelihood, validate ex-post that model fits observed changes in hazard rate w.r.t. $Z_2$

### Key Point

- Even if over-identified, use variation most appropriate for the question
- Validation shows model uses conceptually appropriate sources of variation

---

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{
\textbf{STOP FOR DISCUSSION}

\begin{itemize}
\item How do you think this approach compares to the case where we did not have plausible exogenous variation in wages?
\item How do you think it compares to the case where we had exogenous variation in tax rates explicitly (rather than interpolating via articulated variation: wage rates and marginal tax rates have identical effects)?
\end{itemize}

# Identification with Unobserved Heterogeneity

## Setup

- $K$ unobserved types with population proportions $\pi = \{\pi_k\}_{k=1}^K$
- Types enter through value of unemployment
- Instrument $Z$ shifts flow value in known way:
$$b_k(Z) = b_k + Z$$

## Latent Reservation Wages

$$w_k^*(z) = b_k + Z + \frac{\beta\lambda}{1-\beta(1-\delta)} \int_{w_k^*(z)}[1-F_W(w)]dw$$

- Gives vector of latent hazard rates $h_k(z)$

## Duration Distribution as Mixture

$$\mathbb{P}(t_U = t | E=0, Z) = \sum_k \tilde{\pi}_k h_k(z)(1-h_k(z))^t$$

- $\tilde{\pi}_k$ = representation of type $k$ among unemployed:
$$\tilde{\pi}_k = \frac{\pi_k \frac{\delta}{\delta + h_k(z)}}{U(z)}$$

## Identification Result (Heckman and Singer, 1984)

- For fixed $K$: parameters $(\tilde{\pi}_k, h_k(z))$ are identified from duration distribution

### Completing the Argument (Exercise)

1. Invert $\pi$ and $\delta$ from $\tilde{\pi}$ and unemployment rate $U(z)$
2. State support assumption on $Z$ such that $F_W$ is identified
3. Argue $\lambda$ is identified in this region
4. Argue each $w_k^*(z)$ is identified from $h_k(z)$ and $F_W$
5. Use reservation wage equation to identify each $b_k$ and $\beta$

# Summary

## Key Takeaways

- **Data Requirements:** Cross-sectional data on employment status, wages, and unemployment durations

- **Steady State:** Essential assumption for identification; gives closed-form expressions for distributions

- **Basic Identification:**
  - Hazard rate $h$ from duration distribution
  - Separation rate $\delta$ from unemployment rate
  - Reservation wage $w^*$ from lower bound of observed wages
  - Deep parameters $(b, \beta)$ require normalization

- **Policy Counterfactuals:** Credibility depends on whether identification relies on:
  - Arbitrary parametric assumptions (less credible)
  - Articulated variation from excluded instruments (more credible)

- **Exclusion Restrictions:**
  - Variable affecting only $b$ enables nonparametric identification of $F_W$
  - Known scale restrictions can identify $\beta$

- **The "How" of Identification:**
  - Over-identified models require choosing which moments to match
  - Choose estimation approach to make answer to research question most credible
  - Marschak's maxim: sufficiency for the question of interest

- **Unobserved Heterogeneity:**
  - Mixture models with latent types
  - Identified under support conditions on instruments
