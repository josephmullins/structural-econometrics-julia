# The Dynamic Labor Supply Model

## Starting Point: The Basic Model

- Without heterogeneity and with quasilinear preferences ($\sigma=0$), labor supply is:
$$\log(H_{n,t}) = \psi\log(\alpha) + \psi\log(W_{n,t})$$

- This predicts a perfectly straight line between log hours and log wages
- Clearly, we need more assumptions to bring this model to data

---

## Extending the Model for Estimation

### Preference Heterogeneity

- Let preferences be heterogeneous and decomposed as:
$$\psi\log(\alpha_{n}) = \mu_{\alpha} + \varepsilon_{n},\ \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon] = 0$$

### Measurement Error in Hours

- Assume hours are observed with additive measurement error ($\xi_{n,t}$):
$$\log(H_{n,t}) = \mu_{\alpha} + \psi\log(W_{n,t}) + \varepsilon_{n} + \xi_{n,t}$$

### Wage Equation

- Wages follow:
$$\log(W_{n,t}) = \gamma_{0} + Z_{n,t}\gamma_{1} + \zeta_{n} + \upsilon_{n,t}$$

- $\zeta_{n}$: unobserved permanent component of $n$'s productivity
- $\upsilon_{n,t}$: time-varying shock
- $Z_{n,t}$: variable that shifts labor demand in ways essentially random with respect to individual-level unobservables

## Extending Models: Two Key Questions

When you extend a model to account for randomness in outcomes, keep two things in mind:

1. **What is your theory for why this residual exists?**
   - What is the structural error term in your model?

2. **What other components could explain part of this residual that are *not* in your model?**

### Identification Tasks (in order of importance)

1. Craft an argument and approach consistent with the assumptions of your model
   - Your model may already pose important endogeneity problems to solve

2. Craft an argument and approach that is plausible and robust to potential mechanisms *not* in your model
   - If you don't have (1), there's no point in (2)
   - But addressing (2) goes a long way to convincing your audience

---

# Simple Identification

## The Naive Approach

- Assume unobservables are independent of each other:
$$(\varepsilon_{n}, \xi_{n,t}) \perp (\zeta_{n},\upsilon_{n,t})$$

- This implies:
$$\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{n}+\xi_{n,t}|W_{n,t}] = 0$$

- Sufficient for OLS to consistently recover $\psi$
- Could estimate $\psi$ with a single cross-section by regressing log hours on log wages

### Assessment of This Approach

1. Easy to make an identification argument consistent *inside* the model
2. The modeling assumptions themselves are much harder to justify
   - Think in terms of modeled and unmodeled unobservables

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{
\textbf{STOP FOR DISCUSSION}

\begin{itemize}
\item Think of all the reasons why wages vary across people
\item Think of all the reasons why hours vary across individuals
\item Recall that $\psi$ is a \textit{causal} parameter. Is there anything even remotely plausible about the assumption that the unobserved determinants of wages are uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of hours?
\end{itemize}

# Identification with Instrumental Variables

## The Key Difference

- In the naive OLS approach, the identification condition was:
$$\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon + \xi | W] = 0$$

- This implicitly assumed that *all* variation in $W$ ($Z$, $\upsilon$, and $\zeta$) is essentially random

## The IV Approach

- Extract the "plausibly random" component of wages given by the instrument
- Requires instead:
$$\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon + \xi | Z] = 0$$

- Depending on the nature of $Z$, this can be a much easier assumption to believe and defend

## Why IV is More Credible

- When people say this approach is more *credible*, they mean:
  - The required assumptions for identification are weaker
  - Easier to defend
  - Robust to the kinds of mechanisms that discredited the OLS approach

## The 2SLS Estimand

- For one endogenous variable and one instrument:
$$\alpha_{2SLS} = \frac{\mathbb{C}(\log(H),Z)}{\mathbb{C}(\log(W),Z)}$$

- When $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon + \xi | Z]=0$ and $\gamma_1\neq0$:
$$\alpha_{2SLS} = \psi$$

---

## Whether vs How

- Proving sufficient conditions for identification in either case is straightforward
  - This is the "whether"
  - Usually taken as given without further discussion

- The "how" is more interesting
  - Refers to the *nature* of the respective independence assumptions
  - The independence condition for IV is strictly weaker than for OLS
  - May (depending on $Z$) be much easier to defend *a priori*

### Thinking Outside the Model

- Sometimes out of necessity, we write simple models that imply naive identification is valid *inside the model*
- Example: heterogeneous agent macro models often assume homogeneous preferences (no unobserved heterogeneity)
  - If the model generated the data, OLS would consistently recover elasticities

- **Key point:** Think outside the model
  - Ask whether the identification strategy is robust to mild extensions or mechanisms that were too complicated for your model

# Identification of the Model with Income Effects

## Adding Income Effects Back

- Assume $\sigma>0$; labor supply becomes:
$$\log(H_{n,t}) = \mu_{\alpha} + \psi\log(W_{n,t}) - \sigma\psi\log(C_{n,t}) + \varepsilon_{n} + \xi_{n,t}$$

- Now have access to one cross-section: joint distribution $\mathbb{P}_{Z,W,H,A,C}$
  - $A$ is assets, $C$ is consumption

## The Simple 2SLS Problem

- If we estimate by 2SLS with just $Z$ as an instrument:
$$\log(H) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\log(W) + \epsilon_0$$
$$\log(W) = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1Z + \epsilon_1$$

- With binary $Z\in\{0,1\}$:
$$\alpha_{2SLS} = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\log(H)|Z=1] - \mathbb{E}[\log(H)|Z=0]}{\mathbb{E}[\log(W)|Z=1] - \mathbb{E}[\log(W)|Z=0]}$$

- This identifies the effect of the policy on hours (a specific causal parameter), not directly $\psi$ alone

## Achieving Point Identification

- Rank conditions for IV suggest we need two instruments for two endogenous variables

- Define $\tilde{Z} = M\times Z$ where $M\in\{0,1\}$ indicates whether assets are above/below median

- Key insight: the policy affects consumption differently for high vs low asset individuals
  - This interaction provides the second instrument

- Result: With the interaction $\tilde{Z}$, both $\psi$ and $\sigma$ are identified

---

# Difference in Differences Example

## Setup

- Two cross-sections from periods $t\in\{1,2\}$
- Two demographic groups $G\in\{A,B\}$
- $Z\in\{0,1\}$: presence of a proportional tax subsidy $\tau$
- Only group $B$ is eligible for the subsidy

### Net Wages

$$\mathbb{E}[\log(W)|G,t] = \gamma_{t} + \log(1+\tau)Z_{t}\mathbf{1}\{G=B\} + \omega_{B}\mathbf{1}\{G=B\}$$

- $\omega_{B}$: persistent differences in productivity between groups
- $\gamma_{t}$: aggregate trends

### Hours

$$\mathbb{E}[\log(H)|G,t] = \mu + \kappa_{B}\mathbf{1}\{G=B\} + \psi\mathbb{E}[\log(W)|G,t] - \psi\sigma\mathbb{E}[\log(C)|G,t]$$

---

## Parallel Trends and Identification

- Euler equation implies (under full information, no shocks):
$$\Delta\mathbb{E}[\log(C)|G] = \log(\beta(1+r))$$

- If the policy were never introduced:
$$\Delta\mathbb{E}[\log(H)|G] = \psi(\gamma_{2}-\gamma_{1})$$

- Thus **parallel trends holds** for both log hours and log consumption

### The DD Estimand

- Suppose the policy is introduced **unexpectedly** in period 2
- Difference-in-differences estimand:
$$\alpha^{H}_{DD} = \Delta\mathbb{E}[\log(H)|B] - \Delta\mathbb{E}[\log(H)|A]$$

- Substituting terms:
$$\alpha^{H}_{DD} = \psi\log(1+\tau) - \sigma\psi\alpha^{C}_{DD}$$
  where $\alpha^C_{DD}$ is the effect on log consumption

---

## Key Observations from the DD Example

1. $\alpha^{H}_{DD}$ identifies a very specific causal parameter:
   - The effect of an unannounced policy introduction on hours for group B

2. With data on consumption and hours, we could combine $\alpha^{C}_{DD}$ and $\alpha^{H}_{DD}$ to learn $\psi$ and $\sigma$

3. Groups A and B may differ in preferences, wages, and assets
   - The policy likely has different effects on their consumption
   - Heterogeneous income effects mean these estimands don't identify the effect on group A

4. These estimands also don't identify the effect with different perceived policy persistence

5. If the policy was announced in period 1 and implemented in period 2:
   - **Parallel trends would be violated**

6. Identification here achieved without assuming $Z$ is independent of observables
   - Instead, we exploit the existence of parallel trends

# Identification with Panel Data

## The Panel Data Approach

- Have **panel data** on hours and wages for each individual
- Observe the distribution $\mathbb{P}_{(H_t,W_t,C_t)_{t=1}^{T}}$ for $T$ periods

### First Differences

$$\Delta\log(H) = \psi\Delta\log(W) - \psi\sigma\Delta\log(C) + \Delta \xi_{n,t}$$

- Notice: unobserved permanent heterogeneity ($\varepsilon_n$) is differenced out!

### Identification Condition

$$\mathbb{E}[\Delta \xi_{n,t}|\Delta\log(W),\Delta\log(C)] = 0$$

- Guarantees OLS on first differences recovers $\psi$ and $\psi\sigma$

---

## Panel vs Instrumental Approaches

A consistent theme for solving identification problems:

- **Unobserved heterogeneity** lies at the heart of causal inference problems

- Two main solutions:
  1. **IV approach:** Find variation that is plausibly random
  2. **Panel approach:** Use repeated observations to learn about and handle unobserved variation

---

## Additional Comments on Panel Identification

1. Much like IV, this approach extracts a "more credible" source of variation
   - Uses year-to-year changes
   - Differences out permanent individual differences

2. *Inside* the model: since $\xi$ is assumed iid measurement error, this is valid

3. *Outside* the model: Are there confounding mechanisms?
   - One view: assumptions weaker than cross-sectional OLS, but stronger than a good instrument

4. **Measurement error warning:**
   - If there is also measurement error in wages, the cure could be worse than the disease
   - Measurement error could drive most of the year-to-year wage variation

---

## Whether vs How (Revisited)

- The panel data approach consistently recovers parameters whether or not unobserved heterogeneity is an issue

- One could use this approach even if planning to use parameters in a simpler model without unobserved heterogeneity

- This illustrates the value of robust identification strategies
